Hi!

Here is how my solution looks for your test task.

I didn't use styles and didn't focus much on possible errors; I can add all of that if needed.

In the task, it was required to upload to another service, but it was more convenient for me to work through the editor, so I am using GitHub for storage.
The task didn't mention modal windows or some of the other things I added, but I was interested, so I tried to implement them quickly while keeping the code clean.

If you have any questions or want to contact me, Iâ€™m leaving you my contact details:
